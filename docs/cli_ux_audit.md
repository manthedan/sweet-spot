## 1. CLI Surface Overview

Three entry points (`pyproject.scripts`):

- `sweetspot` - the main CLI (now 2910 lines across `cli.py` + `output.py`, 22 subcommands including `version`, `status`, `scout`, `lane-manager`, `cancel-jobs`)
- `sweetspot-scout` - Spot pool ranking tool (`scout.py`, 533 lines), also available as `sweetspot scout`
- `sweetspot-lane-manager` - multi-region lane allocator (`lane_manager.py`, 224 lines), also available as `sweetspot lane-manager`

22 subcommands under `sweetspot`:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `version` | Print installed package version |
| `status` | Show AWS identity, queue depth, DLQ depth, active workers |
| `scout` | Rank Spot pools (forwards to sweetspot-scout) |
| `lane-manager` | Multi-lane allocation (forwards to sweetspot-lane-manager) |
| `worker` | Run an SQS worker inside AWS Batch |
| `enqueue-jsonl` | Validate and optionally submit tasks to SQS |
| `enqueue-and-submit` | Atomic enqueue + wait-for-visible + submit workers |
| `derive-canary` | Derive a deterministic canary subset |
| `submit-workers` | Size and submit Batch workers (dry-run by default) |
| `supervise-workers` | Multi-loop bounded worker pool supervisor |
| `finalize` | Stream tasks, check done markers, write manifests |
| `repair-plan` | Build repair JSONL excluding active-worker tasks |
| `cleanup-stale-messages` | Dry-run/apply deletion of stale SQS messages |
| `estimate-runtime` | Estimate wall time/cost from telemetry |
| `describe-job` | Inspect a Batch job |
| `cancel-jobs` | Cancel/terminate Batch jobs by name pattern (dry-run by default) |
| `jobs` | List/filter Batch jobs |
| `logs` | Fetch CloudWatch logs for a job/stream |
| `watch-job` | Poll a Batch job until terminal |
| `s3-delete-prefix` | Dry-run/apply bulk S3 prefix deletion |
| `dlq` | Inspect/redrive DLQ messages |
| `doctor` | Preflight AWS prerequisites |

---

## 2. Strengths

1. **Dry-run-by-default culture**: `submit-workers`, `supervise-workers`, `s3-delete-prefix`, `dlq`, `cleanup-stale-messages` all require explicit `--submit`/`--apply`/`--delete`. Excellent UX for a destructive-operations CLI.

2. **Structured JSON output everywhere**: Every command emits a versioned JSON schema (`sweetspot.*.v1`). Makes the CLI scriptable and machine-parseable.

3. **Environment variable fallbacks**: Queue URLs, S3 prefixes, timeouts, etc. all have `SWEETSPOT_*` env var defaults. Good for container/ECS use.

4. **Well-considered safety model**: `--confirm-prefix` for S3 deletion, `min-prefix-chars` guard, reserved env namespaces, S3 prefix allow-listing, conditional done-marker writes.

5. **Comprehensive production loop**: The canary -> estimate -> enqueue-and-submit -> supervise -> finalize -> repair-plan -> cleanup-stale-messages workflow is a well-thought-out production lifecycle.

---

## 3. Usability Issues and Improvement Recommendations

### A. No `--help` epilog or examples in argparse

Every subparser is created with minimal `help=` strings. There are no usage examples in `--help` output. The README has a good "CLI quickstart" but `sweetspot enqueue-jsonl --help` won't show you the canary -> finalize workflow.

**Recommendation**: Add `epilog=` with usage examples to key subparsers, or add a `sweetspot workflow` command that prints the recommended production loop.

### B. No `--output-format` option (JSON-only)

All output is JSON. For interactive terminal use, a human-readable table format would be much better for `jobs`, `dlq`, `describe-job`, `doctor`, `finalize` summary. JSON is great for scripting but hostile for quick operator checks.

**Recommendation**: Add `--format json|table|yaml` (or at least `--quiet`/`--summary-only`) to read-oriented commands (`jobs`, `dlq`, `describe-job`, `doctor`, `logs`, `watch-job`).

### C. Three separate entry points create confusion

`sweetspot`, `sweetspot-scout`, and `sweetspot-lane-manager` are three binaries. An operator has to know which binary to call. The README documents them separately.

**Recommendation**: Make `scout` and `lane-manager` subcommands of `sweetspot` (e.g., `sweetspot scout ...`, `sweetspot lane-manager ...`). Keep the standalone entry points as backwards-compatible shims.

### D. No `sweetspot version` or `sweetspot status` command

There's no way to check the installed version from the CLI, and no single command that shows "what's my current AWS identity, region, queue depth, active workers, DLQ depth" in one shot.

**Recommendation**: Add `sweetspot version` (reads from `importlib.metadata`). Add `sweetspot status` that calls `sts:GetCallerIdentity` + queue depth + active worker count.

### E. No `--profile`/`--region` on several commands

`enqueue-jsonl`, `enqueue-and-submit`, `submit-workers`, `finalize`, `cleanup-stale-messages`, and `dlq` all call `boto3.client(...)` without profile/region. If an operator uses named profiles (common for multi-account), these commands silently use the default chain.

**Recommendation**: Add `--profile` and `--region` to every command that makes AWS calls, or document that these commands rely on the default credential chain and env vars.

### F. Massive argument duplication across submit-workers/supervise-workers/enqueue-and-submit

These three commands share ~20 identical arguments (`--visibility-timeout`, `--heartbeat-seconds`, `--vcpus`, `--memory`, `--env`, `--allowed-s3-prefix`, `--redact-regex`, etc.). This is ~120 lines of repeated `add_argument` calls.

**Recommendation**: Extract a shared argument group function (e.g., `_add_worker_args(p)`) to reduce duplication and prevent drift.

### G. No config file support

For repeated operations with the same queue URL, job queue, job definition, S3 prefixes, etc., there's no way to save defaults. Every invocation needs 8-15 flags.

**Recommendation**: Support `--config config.json` or `~/.sweetspot/config.toml` that pre-populates defaults. This would dramatically improve operator ergonomics.

### H. `finalize` has no `--dry-run` mode

Every other mutating command has dry-run semantics, but `finalize --upload` immediately writes manifests to S3. An operator can't preview what finalize would do without running it (which writes local files at minimum).

**Recommendation**: Add `--dry-run` to `finalize` that validates tasks and checks done markers but doesn't write manifests or upload.

### I. No progress output during long operations

`finalize` has `--progress-interval` (default 1000) but only prints to stderr. `supervise-workers` writes to JSONL but prints nothing to stdout per loop. For long-running operations, there's no visual feedback.

**Recommendation**: Add optional progress bars or at least periodic single-line status updates for `finalize`, `supervise-workers`, `s3-delete-prefix`.

### J. No `sweetspot init` or guided setup

A new user has to read the README, create infra with OpenTofu, build a Docker image, create a tasks.jsonl, and then know which commands to chain. There's no bootstrap helper.

**Recommendation**: Add `sweetspot init` that prompts for queue URL, job queue, job definition, S3 bucket, and generates a config file + example tasks.jsonl.

### K. `logs` command has confusing `--limit` + `--tail` interaction

`--limit` controls how many events to fetch from CloudWatch, then `--tail` slices the last N from that. If both are set, behavior is non-obvious. The naming is inconsistent with the `--tail 50` idiom (which usually means "follow").

**Recommendation**: Rename to `--max-events` and `--last N`, or document the interaction clearly. Consider a `--follow` mode for live tailing.

### L. No `sweetspot cancel` or `sweetspot drain` command

There's no way to cancel in-flight Batch jobs or drain a queue gracefully from the CLI. An operator has to use the AWS Console or raw `aws batch terminate-job` commands.

**Recommendation**: Add `sweetspot cancel-jobs --job-queue X --name-regex Y` and `sweetspot drain-queue --queue-url X`.

### M. Error messages mix `SystemExit` and `RuntimeError`

Some errors raise `SystemExit(msg)` (good, clean exit), others raise `RuntimeError` (uncaught, stack trace). For example, `_send_tasks_to_sqs` raises `RuntimeError` on SQS batch failures.

**Recommendation**: Standardize on `SystemExit` for all operator-facing errors, or catch `RuntimeError`/`ClientError` at the top level and print clean messages.

### N. No shell completion

No `sweetspot completion --shell bash` command to generate shell completions for the 18 subcommands and their flags.

**Recommendation**: If migrating to a framework like `click` or `typer`, this comes for free. With argparse, libraries like `argcomplete` can be used.

### O. 2226-line `cli.py` monolith

The CLI, finalizer logic, repair logic, S3 cleanup logic, doctor checks, and all argparse setup are in a single 2226-line file. This makes the code hard to navigate and test.

**Recommendation**: Split into `cli/` package: `cli/__init__.py` (entry point), `cli/args.py` (argparse setup), `cli/enqueue.py`, `cli/finalize.py`, `cli/jobs.py`, `cli/dlq.py`, `cli/doctor.py`, etc.

### P. No `--queue` alias for `--queue-url` / `--sqs-queue-url`

Different commands use different flag names for the SQS queue URL: `enqueue-jsonl` uses `--queue-url`, `submit-workers` uses `--sqs-queue-url`, `finalize` doesn't need it. This inconsistency makes muscle memory impossible.

**Recommendation**: Standardize on `--queue-url` everywhere, with `--sqs-queue-url` as a deprecated alias.

---

## 5. Re-audit: Detailed findings per item

### A. Help epilog/examples -- RESOLVED

`_add_parser_with_examples()` helper added, used on 10 high-traffic subcommands (`enqueue-jsonl`, `enqueue-and-submit`, `derive-canary`, `submit-workers`, `supervise-workers`, `finalize`, `repair-plan`, `cleanup-stale-messages`, `estimate-runtime`, `doctor`, `status`). Each now shows a concrete usage example in `--help` output. Test `test_high_traffic_help_includes_examples` verifies the epilogs are present.

### B. --output-format -- PARTIALLY RESOLVED

`status` now supports `--format json|table`. The table output is clean and readable (`_print_status_table`). However, other read-oriented commands (`jobs`, `dlq`, `describe-job`, `doctor`, `logs`) are still JSON-only.

**Remaining**: Extend `--format table` to `jobs`, `dlq`, `doctor`, and `describe-job`.

### C. Three separate entry points -- RESOLVED

`sweetspot scout` and `sweetspot lane-manager` now forward to the respective `main()` functions. The standalone `sweetspot-scout` and `sweetspot-lane-manager` entry points are preserved for backwards compatibility. The `scout.main()` and `lane_manager.main()` functions accept `argv` and `prog` parameters for clean forwarding. Tests verify the forwarding works.

### D. version/status command -- RESOLVED

`sweetspot version` reads from `importlib.metadata` and outputs `sweetspot.version.v1` JSON. Falls back to `"0+unknown"` when package metadata is unavailable.

`sweetspot status` calls `sts:GetCallerIdentity`, optionally checks SQS queue depth, DLQ depth, and active Batch worker counts. Supports both `--format json` and `--format table`. Includes active job status breakdown.

### E. --profile/--region -- RESOLVED

All AWS-calling commands now accept `--profile` and `--region`. A shared `_aws_client(args, service)` helper creates session-aware clients when profile/region are set, falling back to `boto3.client` otherwise. `run_worker()` also accepts `profile` and `region` parameters. Tests verify session-based client creation (`test_enqueue_uses_profile_region_session_when_supplied`).

### F. Argument duplication -- NOT ADDRESSED

`submit-workers`, `supervise-workers`, and `enqueue-and-submit` still repeat ~20 identical `add_argument` calls. No shared argument group helper was extracted.

**Remaining**: Extract `_add_worker_args(parser)` to reduce duplication and prevent flag drift.

### G. Config file support -- RESOLVED

Comprehensive implementation via `--config <path.json>` and `SWEETSPOT_CONFIG` env var. Supports `defaults` section plus per-command sections (e.g., `"submit-workers": {...}`). Uses `CONFIG_COMMAND_KEYS` allowlist to prevent injection of irrelevant flags, and `CONFIG_FLAG_MAP` to translate JSON keys to CLI flags. Handles repeatable flags (`--allowed-s3-prefix`, `--s3-prefix`) and boolean flags correctly. Explicit CLI flags always override config values. Tests verify config defaults, per-command overrides, and that non-configurable commands are unaffected.

### H. finalize --dry-run -- NOT ADDRESSED

`finalize` still writes local artifacts on every invocation. No `--dry-run` flag.

### I. Progress output -- NOT ADDRESSED

`finalize` still only emits progress to stderr at `--progress-interval`. `supervise-workers` only prints its final summary. No visual progress feedback.

### J. sweetspot init -- NOT ADDRESSED

No guided setup command.

### K. logs --limit/--tail -- RESOLVED

`--limit` now has `--max-events` as an alias, and `--tail` now has `--last` as an alias. Help text clarifies both. Test `test_logs_accepts_clearer_limit_aliases` verifies the aliases work.

### L. cancel/drain -- NOT ADDRESSED

No `cancel-jobs` or `drain-queue` commands.

### M. Error handling -- RESOLVED

Operator-facing errors are now consistently `SystemExit`. Key changes:
- `_send_tasks_to_sqs`: `RuntimeError` changed to `SystemExit`
- `_queue_arn`: `RuntimeError` changed to `SystemExit`
- `cmd_s3_delete_prefix` flush: `RuntimeError` changed to `SystemExit`
- `cmd_doctor` checks: Internal `RuntimeError` changed to `ValueError` (caught by `_doctor_check`)
- Only remaining `RuntimeError` is a finalizer internal assertion (submitted != checked), which is genuinely a programming error, not an operator error.

Test `test_enqueue_reports_sqs_batch_failure_without_traceback` verifies clean error output.

### N. Shell completion -- NOT ADDRESSED

No completion command or argcomplete integration.

### O. cli.py monolith -- WORSENED

The file grew from 2226 to 2692 lines (466 lines added). The config system, version/status/scout/lane-manager commands, and example helpers were all added to the same file. No package split was done.

**Remaining**: Split into `cli/` package. The config system (`CONFIG_COMMAND_KEYS`, `CONFIG_FLAG_MAP`, `_extract_config_arg`, `_load_config`, `_apply_config_defaults`) alone is ~200 lines that could live in `cli/config.py`.

### P. Queue URL flag inconsistency -- RESOLVED

`submit-workers` and `supervise-workers` now accept `--queue-url` as an alias for `--sqs-queue-url` (both set `dest="sqs_queue_url"`). The config system maps `sqs_queue_url` to `--queue-url`. Test `test_submit_workers_accepts_queue_url_alias` verifies the alias.

### Additional improvements beyond the original audit

1. **enqueue-and-submit dry-run sizing** (`4999b0a`): When not submitting, the command now sizes workers from the task count that would be sent, not just the current SQS depth. This prevents undersized dry-run output when the queue is empty.

2. **enqueue-and-submit backlog floor** (`4999b0a`): After sending messages, the backlog floor accounts for sent messages so SQS approximate-depth lag doesn't cause undersized worker counts.

3. **repair-plan log scanning** (`4999b0a`): `_job_task_ids_from_logs` now uses `filter_log_events` with `filterPattern='"task_id"'` and paginates through results (up to `--log-tail` events, default raised from 100 to 50000). Falls back to `get_log_events` when FilterLogEvents is denied. This makes repair-plan much more reliable for excluding active tasks.

4. **Doctor error cleanup** (`b336960`): Internal checks use `ValueError` instead of `RuntimeError`, caught uniformly by `_doctor_check`.

---

## 6. Re-audit round 2: New findings on latest commits

### B. --output-format -- NOW FULLY RESOLVED

`--format table` is now available on all read-oriented commands: `status`, `jobs`, `describe-job`, `logs`, `watch-job`, `doctor`, and `dlq`. Table output uses the extracted `output.py` module with `print_table`, `print_key_values`, and `format_table_value` helpers. Control characters in log messages are escaped (`test_logs_table_output_escapes_control_characters`). JSON remains the default.

Implementation quality is clean: `format_table_value` handles None, dict/list (JSON-serialized), and all C0/C1 control characters. The `output.py` module is well-separated and reusable.

### F. Argument duplication -- RESOLVED

Three shared argument helper functions extracted:
- `_add_batch_worker_target_args`: `--batch-job-queue`, `--job-definition`, `--job-name-prefix`
- `_add_worker_sizing_args`: `--messages-per-worker`, `--max-workers`, `--min-workers`, `--subtract-active`, `--include-not-visible`
- `_add_worker_runtime_args`: `--vcpus`, `--memory`, `--visibility-timeout`, `--heartbeat-seconds`, `--task-timeout-seconds`, `--retry-attempts`, `--env`, `--allowed-s3-prefix`, `--log-tail-bytes`, `--max-log-bytes`, `--redact-regex`, `--allow-legacy-done-markers`

Used by `submit-workers`, `supervise-workers`, and `enqueue-and-submit`. The `legacy_done_markers_help` parameter allows per-command help text. This eliminated ~120 lines of repeated `add_argument` calls.

### H. finalize --dry-run -- RESOLVED

`sweetspot finalize --dry-run` scans tasks, writes local artifacts, but skips all S3 mutations (no manifest uploads, no READY deletion, no READY publishing). The output report includes `dry_run: true` plus `would_*` fields showing what S3 targets would have been written (`would_final_manifest_s3`, `would_ready_s3`, etc.). `--publish-ready` is allowed with `--dry-run` for previewing READY targets without requiring a live upload.

The implementation is correct: `effective_upload = requested_upload and not dry_run` cleanly gates all S3 write paths. The refused-ready path (incomplete + require-complete) also reports `dry_run` and `would_ready_s3`.

### L. cancel/drain -- PARTIALLY RESOLVED

`sweetspot cancel-jobs` implemented with strong safety guardrails:
- `--job-name-regex` is **required** (no broad cancellation possible)
- Dry-run by default; `--apply` needed for actual cancellation
- `SUBMITTED`/`PENDING`/`RUNNABLE` jobs are cancelled via `cancel_job`
- `STARTING`/`RUNNING` jobs require explicit `--terminate-running` flag (uses `terminate_job`)
- Terminal statuses (SUCCEEDED/FAILED) are always skipped
- `--reason` is passed to the AWS API
- Output includes `matched_count`, `actionable_count`, `cancelled_count`, `terminated_count`, `skipped_count`
- Added to `CONFIG_COMMAND_KEYS` for config file support

Queue drain (`drain-queue`) is still not implemented.

### O. cli.py monolith -- IMPROVED

Table output logic extracted to `sweetspot/output.py` (41 lines: `format_table_value`, `print_table`, `print_key_values`). Shared worker argument helpers extracted to `_add_batch_worker_target_args`, `_add_worker_sizing_args`, `_add_worker_runtime_args` (item F). `cli.py` is still 2869 lines but the extraction pattern is established and can continue incrementally.

### New minor observations

1. **`--format` added to `CONFIG_COMMAND_KEYS`**: Correctly includes `format` for commands that support it (`dlq`, `doctor`, `status`, and others), so config files can set default output format.

2. **`cancel-jobs` in production loop**: README step 6 now references `sweetspot cancel-jobs` as part of the safe production workflow, before stale-message cleanup.

3. **`dlq` table output**: Correctly renders `by_run` and `by_schema` as JSON-serialized values in table mode (via `format_table_value`), since they are dicts.

4. **`watch-job` table output**: Uses single-line tab-separated format per poll iteration, which is appropriate for monitoring.

---

## 8. Re-audit round 2: New issues found

### Q. `cancel-jobs` missing `--format` support -- RESOLVED

`cancel-jobs` now supports `--format json|table`, includes `"format"` in its `CONFIG_COMMAND_KEYS` entry, and renders the matched job list through `_print_table` in table mode. JSON remains the default output.

### R. `supervise-workers` partially bypasses `_add_worker_sizing_args`

`submit-workers` and `enqueue-and-submit` both use `_add_worker_sizing_args` for shared sizing flags, but `supervise-workers` inlines its own `--messages-per-worker` and `--include-not-visible` instead. The remaining sizing flags are replaced by supervisor-specific equivalents (`--target-active-workers`, `--max-active-workers`, `--max-submit-per-loop`), which is correct. However, `--messages-per-worker` and `--include-not-visible` are genuinely shared semantics that could drift independently if the helper is updated later.

**Recommendation**: Either extract just `--messages-per-worker` and `--include-not-visible` into a smaller shared helper used by all three commands, or document that `supervise-workers` intentionally owns these flags.

### S. `enqueue-and-submit` uses different `--queue-url` convention -- RESOLVED

`enqueue-and-submit` and `enqueue-jsonl` now accept `--sqs-queue-url` as an alias for `--queue-url`, and both commands allow `sqs_queue_url` in JSON config defaults. Existing `--queue-url` usage and JSON output behavior are unchanged.

### T. `_print_status_table` builds queue rows manually instead of using `_print_table` -- RESOLVED

`_print_status_table` now collects queue rows and passes them through `_print_table`, so queue values use the shared table formatting path.

### U. `watch-job` table header uses a manual boolean flag pattern

The `printed_table_header` boolean tracks whether the header has been printed across poll iterations. This works correctly, but the pattern is fragile: if someone adds an early-return or exception path between the header check and data print, the header could appear without data. Using `_print_key_values` per iteration (which always includes the title) would be more robust, though slightly more verbose.

**Recommendation**: Acceptable as-is for a monitoring command. If refactored later, prefer `_print_key_values` per iteration.

### V. `finalize --dry-run` writes local artifacts by design

`--dry-run` skips S3 mutations but still writes `final_manifest.json`, `task_status.jsonl`, `repair_tasks.jsonl`, and `outputs.jsonl` to the local artifact directory. This is documented in the `--help` text ("Scan and write local artifacts, but skip S3 manifest uploads") and is intentional. However, an operator using `finalize --dry-run` in a CI gate or ephemeral container still needs a writable filesystem.

**Recommendation**: Acceptable as-is. If a future use case requires pure no-side-effect dry-run, add a `--no-artifacts` flag or stream results to stdout instead.
