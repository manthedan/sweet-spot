# Miser

Miser is a cost-aware AWS Batch Spot work runner for trusted, idempotent, embarrassingly parallel workloads.

The installed CLI is `spotbatch`. Older docs and package metadata may still refer to the original package name, `aws-batch-job-runner`.

This project packages a reliability pattern for large retryable AWS Batch jobs:

```text
SQS task message
→ worker checks deterministic S3 done marker
→ if done exists: delete/ack message
→ else process task
→ upload output/summary
→ upload done marker last
→ only then delete/ack message
```

If a Spot host dies before ack, SQS visibility timeout returns the task. If a task repeatedly fails, SQS redrives it to the DLQ.

Miser is an at-least-once runner, not an exactly-once transaction system. The SQS queue is a trusted control plane: anyone who can enqueue a task can choose the command executed by the worker task role. Commands must therefore be trusted and idempotent, or use `task_id` as their own idempotency key for external side effects. Do not expose the queue to untrusted producers.

## What it is

AWS-specific, OpenTofu-compatible framework for embarrassingly parallel jobs:

- batch inference / annotation
- dataset conversion
- web scraping
- simulation sweeps
- self-play generation
- CPU-heavy ETL

## What it is not

- not cloud agnostic
- not a scheduler replacing AWS Batch
- not tied to chess or any single project

Chess/Stockfish workflows live under `examples/`.

## Install for development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --constraint requirements.lock -e .

# optional local closeout checks used by CI
pip install --constraint requirements-dev.lock -e '.[dev]'
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy spotbatch
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# full local release closeout (also runs OpenTofu checks when tofu is installed)
scripts/verify_release.sh
```

## Minimal task schema

Each SQS message is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema": "spotbatch.task.v1",
  "run_id": "hello-001",
  "task_id": "task-000001",
  "command": ["python", "/app/hello_worker.py"],
  "timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "output_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/shards/task-000001.txt",
  "summary_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/summaries/task-000001.summary.json",
  "done_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/done/task-000001.done.json"
}
```

The worker sets environment variables for the command:

```text
SPOTBATCH_TASK_JSON       path to local task JSON
SPOTBATCH_TASK_ID
SPOTBATCH_RUN_ID
SPOTBATCH_TASK_HASH       stable hash of the task fields committed by the worker
SPOTBATCH_ATTEMPT_ID      immutable execution attempt id
SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_PATH     local path to write if output_s3 should be uploaded by framework
SPOTBATCH_METRICS_PATH    optional JSON metrics file written by the command for cost telemetry
SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_S3       attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SPOTBATCH_SUMMARY_S3      attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SPOTBATCH_DONE_S3         canonical conditional done marker URI
SPOTBATCH_TASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS default task timeout used by the worker (default: 39600 / 11h)
```

If `output_s3` is present, the command must create `SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_PATH` before exiting successfully; otherwise the task is treated as failed and no done marker is written. Successful workers upload output, summaries, and stdout/stderr under attempt-scoped S3 paths, then publish the canonical done marker with a conditional `If-None-Match: *` write. If another duplicate attempt won first, the worker validates the winning marker before deleting the SQS message.

For v2 markers, `output_s3` in the task is the logical output URI used for task hashing; the actual immutable object URI is recorded in the done marker's `output.uri` and in finalizer outputs manifests.

Task payloads are validated as `spotbatch.task.v1` before execution: `run_id`, `task_id`, `command`, timeout, env, marker URIs, and S3 URI syntax must pass bounded checks. Task-provided `env` keys may not start with `SPOTBATCH_`, `AWS_`, or `ECS_`; those namespaces are reserved for the framework and runtime.

For production, set `SPOTBATCH_ALLOWED_S3_PREFIXES` or pass `--allowed-s3-prefix` to `spotbatch worker` / `submit-workers` / `supervise-workers`. When configured, every `s3://...` URI found in the task payload, including command arguments and derived done markers, must be inside one of those prefixes.

Finalization is streaming and scale-oriented: `spotbatch finalize` reads task JSONL line-by-line, writes complete `task_status.jsonl`, `repair_tasks.jsonl`, and `outputs.jsonl` artifacts, and keeps only bounded samples in `final_manifest.json`. Use `--use-listing-index` or repeat `--preload-s3-prefix` for large runs to trade S3 LIST calls for fewer per-task HEAD requests.

Worker observability is on by default: child stdout/stderr are streamed to container logs for CloudWatch, a bounded redacted tail is stored in the task summary, and capped redacted attempt logs are uploaded to S3. Use `--log-tail-bytes`, `--max-log-bytes`, and repeatable `--redact-regex` on `worker`, `submit-workers`, or `supervise-workers` for sensitive workloads. Redaction is applied per newline-terminated log record; overlong unterminated records are suppressed with a placeholder rather than risk leaking a partial secret.

For measured cost optimization, tasks may write a JSON object to `SPOTBATCH_METRICS_PATH`, for example `{"completed_units": 100000, "useful_compute_seconds": 3600, "input_bytes": 1048576, "output_bytes": 524288}`. The worker includes this under `summary.telemetry` together with instance/architecture/Region/AZ/image best-effort metadata, SQS receive count/retry status, startup delay from SQS sent timestamp, bytes transferred, interruption/failure status, and discarded compute seconds. `spotbatch-spot-scout --observed-summaries ...` consumes these summaries to rank pools by expected total cost, not only Spot price.

Task timeouts are capped below SQS's 12-hour visibility ceiling. Prefer much shorter shards, and checkpoint/split work that cannot fit safely under the default 11-hour cap.

## OpenTofu

`infra/opentofu/` creates:

- SQS work queue + DLQ with SSE enabled, longer DLQ retention, and a by-source-queue redrive allow policy
- AWS Batch Spot compute environment and queue
- optional On-Demand repair queue
- least-privilege IAM roles scoped to the work queue and configured S3 bucket/prefixes
- a no-ingress Batch security group by default, plus an IMDSv2-required encrypted-root launch template
- generic worker job definition with runtime S3-prefix validation
- CloudWatch dashboard and baseline alarms for queue age, DLQ depth, Batch failures, and runnable-job stalls
- optional monthly AWS Budget alerts

Runtime and dev dependency lock files (`requirements.lock`, `requirements-dev.lock`) pin the Python dependency graph used by Docker and CI. The worker Dockerfile pins its Python base image by digest and drops to an unprivileged `spotbatch` user. CI runs unit tests, Ruff formatting/linting, typing, OpenTofu lock/fmt/validate checks, and a container build with SBOM/provenance attestations plus Trivy scanning.

See `infra/opentofu/README.md`.

## Cost case studies and release hygiene
