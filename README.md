# SweetSpot

SweetSpot runs millions of trusted, idempotent tasks on AWS Batch Spot as cheaply as possible, with SQS retries, S3 done markers, repair manifests, and cost-aware lane selection.

It is **not** a general ETL orchestrator. SweetSpot is the low-level execution harness you reach for when the work is already a large set of independent commands and the hard part is making a cheap Spot run durable, observable, and recoverable.

## The problem

You have a huge batch job:

- annotate 10M chess positions,
- run batch inference,
- generate self-play games,
- convert a dataset,
- run simulation sweeps,
- scrape or enrich many independent records,
- or process CPU-heavy rows where each unit can be retried safely.

Raw AWS Batch gives you containers and scheduling, but you still have to build task fanout, retry semantics, completion ledgers, repair manifests, finalization, and cost-aware lane choices. Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, Glue, Ray, Dask, and Step Functions are useful tools, but they are not specialized for cheap, homogeneous, at-least-once AWS Batch Spot fanout.

SweetSpot fills that gap.

## What SweetSpot does

SweetSpot packages a boring durable protocol:

```text
SQS task message
-> worker checks deterministic S3 done marker
-> if done exists: delete/ack message
-> else process task
-> upload output/summary
-> upload done marker last
-> only then delete/ack message
```

If a Spot host dies before ack, SQS visibility timeout returns the task. If a task repeatedly fails, SQS redrives it to the DLQ. Finalization walks the task list and S3 done markers to build durable manifests and repair plans.

SweetSpot is **at-least-once**, not exactly-once. The SQS queue is a trusted control plane: anyone who can enqueue a task can choose the command executed by the worker task role. Commands must therefore be trusted and idempotent.

## Five nouns to learn

- **JobSpec**: the run request: workload, task shape, budget/deadline hints, and deployment references.
- **Task**: one trusted command plus S3 output, summary, and done-marker paths.
- **Run**: one execution attempt for a JobSpec, with local `run_state.json` and cloud resources.
- **Done marker**: the deterministic S3 object written last by a successful task.
- **Manifest**: the final ledger proving which tasks completed, which are missing, and what to repair.

Everything else -- canaries, lifecycle reports, doctors, repair, cleanup, and admin commands -- is operator machinery around those five ideas.

## When to use SweetSpot

Use SweetSpot when:

- the workload is embarrassingly parallel,
- each task is trusted and idempotent,
- results can be written to S3,
- at-least-once execution is acceptable,
- AWS Batch Spot cost matters,
- and you want machine-readable recovery surfaces instead of one-off glue scripts.

Do **not** use SweetSpot when you need:

- arbitrary external side effects with exactly-once semantics,
- an asset graph, lineage UI, catalog, or human workflow scheduler,
- multi-cloud abstraction,
- untrusted user-submitted commands,
- or interactive distributed Python compute.

## Happy path

The public path is intentionally small:

```bash
# 1. Create local project context and starter artifacts.
sweetspot init --config examples/setup.example.yaml --project-dir .sweetspot

# 2. Validate local setup without touching AWS.
sweetspot doctor project --project-dir .sweetspot --format json

# 3. Render AWS bootstrap intent for review.
sweetspot bootstrap plan --project-dir .sweetspot --format json

# 4. After reviewing the plan, apply with the exact confirmation token.
sweetspot bootstrap apply --project-dir .sweetspot --confirm apply:<token> --format json

# 5. Plan and launch a run from a JobSpec/deployment.
sweetspot plan .sweetspot/job.json
sweetspot run .sweetspot/job.json --deployment .sweetspot/deployment.json --apply --kickoff-only

# 6. Monitor and close out.
sweetspot status RUN_ID --from-state
sweetspot finish RUN_ID --from-state --publish-ready
```

For agent or CI operation, keep long polling out of the foreground: launch with `--kickoff-only`, then checkpoint with `sweetspot monitor RUN_ID --emit-command` or `sweetspot status RUN_ID --from-state` from a scheduler.

## Install for development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --constraint requirements.lock -e '.[dev]'
ruff check . && mypy sweetspot && python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

For full release closeout, including OpenTofu checks when `tofu` is installed, run:

```bash
scripts/verify_release.sh
```

## Local setup contract

`init` writes local setup state and starter artifacts only. It records AWS region/auth profile or role references for review, but does not provision AWS resources, create queues/buckets/roles, deploy workers, perform live AWS checks, or store credentials.

`sweetspot doctor project --format json` emits the `sweetspot.project.doctor.v1` local validation surface with top-level `ok`, `checks`, and `summary`. Invalid setup and secret-looking material fail closed; review placeholders can remain warnings until customized.

See `docs/setup.md` for the full first-run handoff, generated `.sweetspot/` layout, AWS auth boundary, bootstrap plan/apply lifecycle, and troubleshooting.

## Task schema (`sweetspot.task.v1`)

Each SQS message is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema": "sweetspot.task.v1",
  "run_id": "hello-001",
  "task_id": "task-000001",
  "command": ["python", "/app/hello_worker.py"],
  "timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "output_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/shards/task-000001.txt",
  "summary_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/summaries/task-000001.summary.json",
  "done_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/done/task-000001.done.json"
}
```

The worker sets environment variables for the command (`SWEETSPOT_TASK_JSON`, `SWEETSPOT_TASK_ID`, `SWEETSPOT_RUN_ID`, `SWEETSPOT_OUTPUT_PATH`, `SWEETSPOT_METRICS_PATH`, `SWEETSPOT_TASK_HASH`, `SWEETSPOT_ATTEMPT_ID`, `SWEETSPOT_DONE_S3`). See `docs/reliability_contract.md` for the full protocol.

## Advanced CLI reference

The primary agent interface uses a high-level controller workflow. Lower-level operator utilities are grouped under `sweetspot admin ...`.

| Command | Purpose | Key flags |

| `sweetspot plan` | Generate canary and production plans from a JobSpec. | `--input-manifest-jsonl`, `--out-canary-tasks-jsonl`, `--canary-summary-jsonl` |
| `sweetspot run` | Execute canaries, submit production workers, reconcile. | `--deployment`, `--apply`, `--kickoff-only`, `--reconcile-until-drained`, `--finalize` |
| `sweetspot monitor RUN_ID` | Emit non-blocking scheduler/CI status and finalize checkpoint commands. | `--emit-command`, `--interval`, `--output-prefix` |
| `sweetspot status RUN_ID` | Summarize run artifacts, S3 done-marker progress, and active Batch workers. | `--from-state`, `--format table`, `--queue-url`, `--job-queue`, `--output-prefix` |
| `sweetspot finalize RUN_ID` | Reconstruct finalization from `run_state.json` and persisted production tasks. | `--from-state`, `--upload`, `--publish-ready`, `--dry-run` |

| `sweetspot explain RUN_ID` | Explain reconstructed lifecycle state and next actions without mutating AWS. | `--from-state`, `--format text` |
| `sweetspot postmortem RUN_ID` | Write a JSON or Markdown postmortem from state/finalizer/finish artifacts. | `--from-state`, `--format markdown`, `--out` |
| `sweetspot cleanup RUN_ID` | Plan conservative lifecycle cleanup from state; destructive admin actions stay explicit. | `--from-state`, `--dry-run`, `--apply` |
| `sweetspot repair RUN_ID` | Build and optionally apply run-scoped repair plans. | `--task-status-jsonl`, `--apply` |
| `sweetspot cancel RUN_ID` | Safely cancel run-scoped Batch jobs (dry-run by default). | `--apply` |
| `sweetspot admin enqueue-jsonl` | Validate and submit tasks to SQS. | `--queue-url`, `--tasks-jsonl`, `--submit` |
| `sweetspot admin submit-workers` | Size and submit Batch workers (dry-run by default). | `--batch-job-queue`, `--job-definition`, `--submit` |
| `sweetspot admin supervise-workers` | Multi-loop bounded worker pool supervisor. | `--target-active-workers`, `--loops`, `--submit` |
| `sweetspot admin finalize` | Stream tasks, check done markers, write manifests. | `--upload`, `--publish-ready`, `--dry-run` |
| `sweetspot admin doctor` | Preflight AWS/SQS/S3/Batch/CloudWatch prerequisites. | `--queue-url`, `--job-queue`, `--s3-prefix`, `--check-run-queue-create` |
| `sweetspot admin scout` | Rank Spot pools by expected total cost (read-only). | `--preset mixed`, `--observed-summaries`, `--regions` |
| `sweetspot admin lane-manager` | Multi-region cost-aware lane allocation. | `--config lanes.json` |

> Always use `sweetspot admin scout --preset smallest` or `--preset mixed` before large runs to compare cheap x86 and ARM/Graviton lanes from canary telemetry. For 2 GiB medium instances, reserve less than the full host memory (for example 1536 MiB) so Batch/ECS can schedule the job. Do not steer users to `t3*`/`t4g*` small or micro lanes for managed AWS Batch: Batch rejects those burstable instance types before workers can run.

Config files (`--config` or `SWEETSPOT_CONFIG`) can pre-populate common flags. All mutating commands are dry-run by default. For production launches from an interactive coding agent, prefer `sweetspot run ... --apply --kickoff-only` and then monitor with `sweetspot monitor RUN_ID --emit-command` / `sweetspot status RUN_ID --from-state` from a scheduled/CI checkpoint; use `sweetspot finish RUN_ID --from-state --publish-ready` after queues/DLQ/Batch drain, then `sweetspot explain RUN_ID --from-state`, `sweetspot postmortem RUN_ID --from-state`, and `sweetspot cleanup RUN_ID --from-state --dry-run` for closeout reporting. `--from-state` lifecycle commands intentionally bind to the output prefix and production task JSONL recorded in `run_state.json`; conflicting finalizer overrides return a structured `binding_drift` report with the recorded source/value, override source/value, unsafe reason, and exact recovery command. Reserve `--reconcile-until-drained` foreground watch loops for unattended shells or active diagnostics. Production queue creation requires `sqs:CreateQueue`/tagging/redrive permissions; preflight with `sweetspot admin doctor --check-run-queue-create --run-queue-name NAME`; if creation is denied, SweetSpot emits a `run_queue_create_denied` recovery message with the doctor command, required queue settings, and safe pre-provisioned-queue fallback. If those permissions are unavailable, use a pre-provisioned empty run-scoped queue and document the fallback before enqueueing.
