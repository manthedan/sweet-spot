# Miser

Miser is a cost-aware AWS Batch Spot work runner for trusted, idempotent, embarrassingly parallel workloads.

The installed CLI is `spotbatch`. Older docs and package metadata may still refer to the original package name, `aws-batch-job-runner`.

This project packages a reliability pattern for large retryable AWS Batch jobs:

```text
SQS task message
→ worker checks deterministic S3 done marker
→ if done exists: delete/ack message
→ else process task
→ upload output/summary
→ upload done marker last
→ only then delete/ack message
```

If a Spot host dies before ack, SQS visibility timeout returns the task. If a task repeatedly fails, SQS redrives it to the DLQ.

Miser is an at-least-once runner, not an exactly-once transaction system. The SQS queue is a trusted control plane: anyone who can enqueue a task can choose the command executed by the worker task role. Commands must therefore be trusted and idempotent, or use `task_id` as their own idempotency key for external side effects.

## What it is

AWS-specific, OpenTofu-compatible framework for embarrassingly parallel jobs:

- batch inference / annotation
- dataset conversion
- web scraping
- simulation sweeps
- self-play generation
- CPU-heavy ETL

## What it is not

- not cloud agnostic
- not a scheduler replacing AWS Batch
- not tied to chess or any single project

Chess/Stockfish workflows live under `examples/`.

## Install for development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Minimal task schema

Each SQS message is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema": "spotbatch.task.v1",
  "run_id": "hello-001",
  "task_id": "task-000001",
  "command": ["python", "/app/hello_worker.py"],
  "timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "output_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/shards/task-000001.txt",
  "summary_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/summaries/task-000001.summary.json",
  "done_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/done/task-000001.done.json"
}
```

The worker sets environment variables for the command:

```text
SPOTBATCH_TASK_JSON       path to local task JSON
SPOTBATCH_TASK_ID
SPOTBATCH_RUN_ID
SPOTBATCH_TASK_HASH       stable hash of the task fields committed by the worker
SPOTBATCH_ATTEMPT_ID      immutable execution attempt id
SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_PATH     local path to write if output_s3 should be uploaded by framework
SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_S3       attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SPOTBATCH_SUMMARY_S3      attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SPOTBATCH_DONE_S3         canonical conditional done marker URI
SPOTBATCH_TASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS default task timeout used by the worker (default: 39600 / 11h)
```

If `output_s3` is present, the command must create `SPOTBATCH_OUTPUT_PATH` before exiting successfully; otherwise the task is treated as failed and no done marker is written. Successful workers upload output, summaries, and stdout/stderr under attempt-scoped S3 paths, then publish the canonical done marker with a conditional `If-None-Match: *` write. If another duplicate attempt won first, the worker validates the winning marker before deleting the SQS message.

For v2 markers, `output_s3` in the task is the logical output URI used for task hashing; the actual immutable object URI is recorded in the done marker's `output.uri` and in the final manifest `outputs` list.

Task-provided `env` keys may not start with `SPOTBATCH_`, `AWS_`, or `ECS_`; those namespaces are reserved for the framework and runtime.

Task timeouts are capped below SQS's 12-hour visibility ceiling. Prefer much shorter shards, and checkpoint/split work that cannot fit safely under the default 11-hour cap.
