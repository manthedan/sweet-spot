# SweetSpot

SweetSpot is a cost-aware AWS Batch Spot work runner for trusted, idempotent, embarrassingly parallel workloads.

Install the Python package and use the `sweetspot` CLI for enqueueing, worker submission, finalization, diagnostics, Spot scouting, and lane management.

This project packages a reliability pattern for large retryable AWS Batch jobs:

```text
SQS task message
→ worker checks deterministic S3 done marker
→ if done exists: delete/ack message
→ else process task
→ upload output/summary
→ upload done marker last
→ only then delete/ack message
```

If a Spot host dies before ack, SQS visibility timeout returns the task. If a task repeatedly fails, SQS redrives it to the DLQ.

SweetSpot is an at-least-once runner, not an exactly-once transaction system. The SQS queue is a trusted control plane: anyone who can enqueue a task can choose the command executed by the worker task role. Commands must therefore be trusted and idempotent, or use `task_id` as their own idempotency key for external side effects. Do not expose the queue to untrusted producers.

## What it is

AWS-specific, OpenTofu-compatible framework for embarrassingly parallel jobs:

- batch inference / annotation
- dataset conversion
- web scraping
- simulation sweeps
- self-play generation
- CPU-heavy ETL

## What it is not

- not cloud agnostic
- not a scheduler replacing AWS Batch
- not tied to chess or any single project

Chess/Stockfish workflows live under `examples/`.

## Install for development

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contributor workflow, trust-boundary expectations, and release hygiene.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --constraint requirements.lock -e .

# optional local closeout checks used by CI
pip install --constraint requirements-dev.lock -e '.[dev]'
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy sweetspot
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# full local release closeout (also runs OpenTofu checks when tofu is installed)
scripts/verify_release.sh
```

## Minimal task schema

Each SQS message is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema": "sweetspot.task.v1",
  "run_id": "hello-001",
  "task_id": "task-000001",
  "command": ["python", "/app/hello_worker.py"],
  "timeout_seconds": 3600,
  "output_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/shards/task-000001.txt",
  "summary_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/summaries/task-000001.summary.json",
  "done_s3": "s3://my-bucket/runs/hello-001/done/task-000001.done.json"
}
```

The worker sets environment variables for the command:

```text
SWEETSPOT_TASK_JSON       path to local task JSON
SWEETSPOT_TASK_ID
SWEETSPOT_RUN_ID
SWEETSPOT_TASK_HASH       stable hash of the task fields committed by the worker
SWEETSPOT_ATTEMPT_ID      immutable execution attempt id
SWEETSPOT_OUTPUT_PATH     local path to write if output_s3 should be uploaded by framework
SWEETSPOT_METRICS_PATH    optional JSON metrics file written by the command for cost telemetry
SWEETSPOT_OUTPUT_S3       attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SWEETSPOT_SUMMARY_S3      attempt-scoped S3 URI used by this execution
SWEETSPOT_DONE_S3         canonical conditional done marker URI
SWEETSPOT_TASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS default task timeout used by the worker (default: 39600 / 11h)
```

If `output_s3` is present, the command must create `SWEETSPOT_OUTPUT_PATH` before exiting successfully; otherwise the task is treated as failed and no done marker is written. Successful workers upload output, summaries, and stdout/stderr under attempt-scoped S3 paths, then publish the canonical done marker with a conditional `If-None-Match: *` write (412 means an existing marker won; transient 409 conditional conflicts are retried). If another duplicate attempt won first, the worker validates the winning marker before deleting the SQS message.

For v2 markers, `output_s3` in the task is the logical output URI used for task hashing; the actual immutable object URI is recorded in the done marker's `output.uri` and in finalizer outputs manifests.

Task payloads are validated as `sweetspot.task.v1` before execution: `run_id`, `task_id`, `command`, timeout, env, marker URIs, and S3 URI syntax must pass bounded checks. Task-provided `env` keys may not start with `SWEETSPOT_`, `AWS_`, or `ECS_`; those namespaces are reserved for the framework and runtime.

For production, set `SWEETSPOT_ALLOWED_S3_PREFIXES` or pass `--allowed-s3-prefix` to `sweetspot worker` / `submit-workers` / `supervise-workers`. When configured, every `s3://...` URI found in the task payload, including command arguments and derived done markers, must be under one of those prefixes. Exact-key equality to a non-root prefix is rejected so runtime validation matches the OpenTofu IAM policy's `${prefix}/*` object scope.

Legacy v1 done markers are not accepted by default because they do not bind the full task hash or immutable attempt output. Use `--allow-legacy-done-markers` / `SWEETSPOT_ALLOW_LEGACY_DONE_MARKERS=1` only for an explicit migration pass, including `sweetspot finalize --allow-legacy-done-markers` for old runs.

Finalization is streaming and scale-oriented: `sweetspot finalize` reads task JSONL line-by-line, writes complete `task_status.jsonl`, `repair_tasks.jsonl`, and `outputs.jsonl` artifacts, and keeps only bounded samples in `final_manifest.json`. Use `--dry-run` to preview upload/READY targets while still writing local artifacts but skipping S3 uploads, READY deletion, and READY publishing. Use `--use-listing-index` or repeat `--preload-s3-prefix` for large runs to trade S3 LIST calls for fewer per-task HEAD requests.

Worker observability is on by default: child stdout/stderr are streamed to container logs for CloudWatch, a bounded redacted tail is stored in the task summary, and capped redacted attempt logs are uploaded to S3. Use `--log-tail-bytes`, `--max-log-bytes`, and repeatable `--redact-regex` on `worker`, `submit-workers`, or `supervise-workers` for sensitive workloads. Redaction is applied per newline-terminated log record; overlong unterminated records are suppressed with a placeholder rather than risk leaking a partial secret.

For measured cost optimization, tasks may write a JSON object to `SWEETSPOT_METRICS_PATH`, for example `{"completed_units": 100000, "useful_compute_seconds": 3600, "input_bytes": 1048576, "output_bytes": 524288}`. The worker includes this under `summary.telemetry` together with instance/architecture/Region/AZ/image best-effort metadata, SQS receive count/retry status, startup delay from SQS sent timestamp, bytes transferred, interruption/failure status, and discarded compute seconds. `sweetspot-scout --observed-summaries ...` consumes these summaries to rank pools by expected total cost, not only Spot price.

Task timeouts are capped below SQS's 12-hour visibility ceiling. Prefer much shorter shards, and checkpoint/split work that cannot fit safely under the default 11-hour cap.

## Sizing and repair safety

SweetSpot works best when each task is small, trusted, and idempotent. Do **not** launch huge uncheckpointed tasks on Spot just because your input files are large. First run a representative canary, estimate throughput, then choose a chunk size whose predicted per-task runtime is comfortably below your timeout and cheap to replay after interruption.

A safe production loop is:

1. derive and run a canary;
2. estimate runtime/cost from canary telemetry with `sweetspot estimate-runtime`;
3. enqueue and submit in one command with `sweetspot enqueue-and-submit --wait-for-visible-seconds ...` to avoid SQS approximate-depth races;
4. finalize to produce `task_status.jsonl` and `repair_tasks.jsonl`;
5. build repairs with `sweetspot repair-plan`, excluding tasks already owned by active workers;
6. dry-run guarded `sweetspot cancel-jobs` before stopping any matching Batch jobs;
7. dry-run then apply `sweetspot cleanup-stale-messages` for visible duplicate messages whose done markers already exist.

For Spot, prefer many short tasks over a few long tasks. If a task cannot checkpoint or finish quickly, use an On-Demand repair lane or split it further.

## Agent-facing direction

The commands below expose SweetSpot's current operator phases. They remain useful for advanced debugging and controlled production runs, but they are not the intended long-term agent contract. SweetSpot is moving toward `sweetspot plan`, `sweetspot run`, `sweetspot status`, `sweetspot repair`, and `sweetspot cancel`, where agents provide workload intent, budget, deadline, and output locations while SweetSpot chooses shard size, resource shape, architecture, and parallelism.

Until that controller is complete, treat direct sizing flags such as worker count, vCPU, memory, task timeout, shard size, and messages per worker as advanced controls that require canary evidence and dry-run review. Adaptive shard-sizing helpers now consume canary summaries internally so the future controller can grow from tiny replay-safe canaries instead of asking agents to invent chunk sizes; `sweetspot plan --canary-summary-jsonl summaries.jsonl --input-manifest-jsonl manifest.jsonl` exposes that shard-sizing decision and production shard count in JSON without mutating AWS resources. Add `--out-production-tasks-jsonl artifacts/tasks.jsonl` to explicitly materialize calibrated `sweetspot.task.v1` production shards as a local artifact for review/enqueue. `sweetspot run JOB_SPEC` is available as a safe dry-run controller report that can persist `run_state.json` and local production task artifacts with `--artifact-dir`, but `sweetspot run --apply` is intentionally rejected until the cloud orchestration layer is implemented. `sweetspot cancel RUN_ID` is the simplified cancellation entrypoint for run-scoped Batch job names; broader regex cancellation remains available through the advanced `cancel-jobs` command.

## Recommended cost optimization workflow

Cost optimization works best when it starts before the main run, not after workers are already launched:

1. Generate small, idempotent task shards that are cheap to replay after Spot interruption.
2. Run a representative canary on the same worker image and command you plan to use in production.
3. Have the task command write `SWEETSPOT_METRICS_PATH` with `completed_units`, `useful_compute_seconds`, and input/output byte counts.
4. Estimate task size and timeout safety with `sweetspot estimate-runtime`.
5. Run `sweetspot scout --preset mixed --observed-summaries ...` to compare x86 and ARM/Graviton pools by expected total cost, including replay, startup overhead, placement score, and non-compute costs.
6. Treat ARM as opt-in: Graviton can be materially cheaper, but only use ARM lanes after a canary proves the workload, dependencies, and container image are ARM-compatible. Keep x86 as the safe default when compatibility is unknown.
7. Feed the selected `expected_total_cost_per_1m_units` values into `sweetspot lane-manager`; it allocates cost-annotated eligible lanes cheapest-first and can keep an On-Demand repair lane for tail work.

Do not mix x86 and ARM instance types in one Batch queue unless the job image is verified multi-arch and every native dependency works on both architectures. Otherwise, use separate x86 and ARM queues/job definitions and model them as separate lanes.

## OpenTofu

`infra/opentofu/` creates:

- SQS work queue + DLQ with SSE enabled, longer DLQ retention, and a by-source-queue redrive allow policy
- AWS Batch Spot compute environment and queue
- optional On-Demand repair queue
- least-privilege IAM roles scoped to the work queue and configured S3 bucket/prefixes
- a no-ingress Batch security group by default, plus an IMDSv2-required encrypted-root launch template
- generic worker job definition with runtime S3-prefix validation
- CloudWatch dashboard and baseline alarms for queue age, DLQ depth, Batch failures, and runnable-job stalls
- optional monthly AWS Budget alerts

Runtime and dev dependency lock files (`requirements.lock`, `requirements-dev.lock`) pin the Python dependency graph used by Docker and CI. The worker Dockerfile pins its Python base image by digest and drops to an unprivileged `sweetspot` user. CI runs unit tests, Ruff formatting/linting, typing, OpenTofu lock/fmt/validate checks, and a container build with SBOM/provenance attestations plus Trivy scanning.

See `infra/opentofu/README.md`.

## Cost case studies and release hygiene

- `examples/lanes.mixed-arch.example.json` shows separate x86 and ARM/Graviton lanes with per-lane placement-score instance lists.
- `docs/case_study_template.md` is the companion prose template for public Spot vs On-Demand comparisons when Cost Explorer data is unavailable or private.
- `scripts/verify_release.sh` runs the local closeout checks that mirror CI-critical gates.
- `docs/release_checklist.md` covers branch protection, action pin updates, and release/tag hygiene.
- `SECURITY.md` documents the trusted-workload threat model and reporting process.
- `CHANGELOG.md` tracks unreleased production-hardening changes.
